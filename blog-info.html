                            A lot of work goes into taking a photograph. Before
                            the inevitable ‘click’ — chances are you spent time
                            planning what gear you’d bring, checking the weather
                            conditions for the day, experimenting with camera
                            settings, and finding the perfect framing for your
                            shot. But what happens next is equally
                            transformative.

                            Editing. Some photographers love it, many simply put
                            up with it — but the reality is: editing has the
                            power to elevate and enhance what you’ve worked hard
                            to capture. We spoke with three Unsplash
                            contributors about all things editing — from their
                            top tips for beginners looking to improve their
                            skills, to their approach to the editing process.

                            <b>Simone Hutsch :</b> is a graphic designer from
                            Berlin, Germany currently living in London, UK.
                            While photography was always a part of her studies,
                            she only really got into architecture photography
                            after she graduated. It served as a creative outlet.
                            She says, “I first started photography as a personal
                            creative project outside of work, and that’s still
                            the case. I see this as a journey, and what matters
                            to me is that every day I get a tiny bit better and
                            truly enjoy what I’m doing.”

                            <b>Philipp Pilz :</b> is also a designer. But for
                            him, photography has been part of his life since
                            childhood. He first recalls taking photos of cars as
                            a child with a “cheap plastic film camera” before
                            taking party pictures in clubs as a teenager. While
                            he’s been photographing for about 20 years now, it
                            was only when he turned to nature in the last four
                            years that he believes truly found his style. Now,
                            he travels through Europe in his camper van in
                            search of exciting motifs and wild sceneries.

                            <b>Lerone Pieters :</b> first took up photography as
                            a hobby as a teenager, before getting more serious
                            about it thanks to encouragement from his friends
                            and family, as well as an ambition and drive to
                            improve his skills. He says, “I became increasingly
                            interested in finding my niche and eventually
                            pushing past my comfort zone.” Today, he focuses on
                            street photography and portraits.

                        <p>
                            <b>Philipp typically :</b> works in Adobe Lightroom,
                            and in Photoshop on rare occaision. His editing
                            process typically goes something like this: “The
                            first thing I do is apply the color look to my
                            images. This is a custom preset that I developed and
                            refined over a long process. This setting includes
                            pretty much all the controls that are available in
                            Adobe Lightroom: Color, Calibration, Tone Curves,
                            and so on. After that comes the local adjustments —
                            bringing out certain areas and darkening others
                            again. Finally, I clean up the image, removing
                            anything that might interfere with the view of the
                            subject.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Simone, her retouching process begins before
                            reaching her computer. She explains, “My retouching
                            process requires quite a lot of imagination and
                            creativity, before I start, I make sure I’m in the
                            right headspace: I would go for a long relaxing bike
                            ride before or I’d put my favourite playlist on.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it’s time to sit down and edit, for Simone,
                            it’s all about experimentation. She explains, “I try
                            a few different edits on one photo
                            (colours/composition, etc.) and I always consider
                            the bigger picture before I decide on the final
                            edit.” She uses Photoshop because of the “freedom it
                            provides.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “It’s a process of playing around, because only when
                            you start to play with it can you let your creative
                            mind be free. For example, instead of just cutting
                            out a whole building from the background, I’ll take
                            a facade, reflect it, or perspective-transform it in
                            order to distort the layer and give it the
                            perspective of receding into the distance. I’ll also
                            cut out one story of a building and duplicate it
                            multiple times instead of simply showing all the
                            stories.”

                            Learn to love the editing process
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, the key to enjoying editing? Embracing
                            it for what it is. For Simone, what she loves most
                            is “the contrast of being outside in the real world
                            and then diving into the virtual ‘Photoshop
                            Universe’.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Philipp also enjoys the contrast between photography
                            and editing. In fact, he almost prefers it to taking
                            the photos themselves. “It probably has something to
                            do with the convenience of sitting at home in an
                            armchair rather than setting the alarm for 4am to
                            photograph the sunrise on the French cliffs.”
